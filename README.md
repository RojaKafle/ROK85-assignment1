I made a portfolio type website because I needed one anyone and it felt like the best time to not only create one but also pratice CSS,HTML, and Javascript. 

The five pages I made was first the home page. It cluded the nav bar and a phone model which as additional links attached. this feature was added as a way for the viewer to get to know me better. It includes mock apps such as spotify, which I linked it to take it directly to my playlist. Next, is the 'Netflix" it takes the viewers to a new page, where they are able to see some of my favorite shows and movies. They are also able to click the the moivie which will take them to the google overview page. Then I also included a books app, which will take users to another page. There, they can see some of my favorite reads. Then, I included a family app, here they can see some photos of me,my family, and friends.

In addition, on the nav bar, I have included 4 additional pages. About Me, will take views to a new page that has a bit of information on me professionally. Then the projects page, which includes some of my projects from my resume. Also, I have included a contact page. Here views can click my linkedln and it will take them to my page. I have also attached my resume, in which if they click it, it will show the resume on a new tab. 

I used a lot of elements. I used quite a bit of links just because it was easier then attaching images. I also used sections a lot just because it was easier to section off information. In addition, I used div too because it made the layput easier to figure out and create.

For CSS I utalized flex and grid a lot, it helped organize and rrange elements more easily. I also used hover, to add effects on the app mock up or tiles. I also utalized typewriter effect through @keyframes.

For the Javascript, I used a interactive tool for my family tile. Here viewers are able to drag and put the pictures anywhere on the page. In addotion, I also added a hide/show tab on the projects. This is because it was visually appealing and helped prevent information overlaod. By having the hide/show tab , it made the page easier to digest and understand.
